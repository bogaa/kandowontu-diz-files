# disassembly files of different games
- Mostly work in progress SNES or NES disassembly.
- Use diz to view the project ( https://github.com/IsoFrieze/DiztinGUIsh/releases )
- There is a info.txt in the export folders that will tell you the ROM used to create the disassembly. 
- The orginal ROM mentioned is needed to open the diz file with diztinguish and generate the disassembly.

- Once you export you can read the code and assemble with ASAR ( https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar/releases/tag/v1.91 )
